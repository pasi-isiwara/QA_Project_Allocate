## 🎬 Demonstration Steps for Viva

### STEP 1: Show the Workflow File (2 minutes)

**Open:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

**Explain:**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]  # Triggers on push
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]  # Triggers on PR
  workflow_dispatch:              # Manual trigger
```

**Key Points:**
- "This is our GitHub Actions workflow configuration"
- "It triggers automatically on push or can be triggered manually"
- "We have 3 main jobs: Build & Test, Selenium Tests, and Reporting"

### STEP 2: Explain the Build Job (3 minutes)

**Highlight:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [18.x, 20.x]  # Tests on multiple versions

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7.0              # MongoDB for tests
```

**Key Points:**
- "We test on Node.js 18 and 20 for compatibility"
- "MongoDB runs as a service container"
- "We install dependencies, build the project, and run unit tests"

**Show test commands:**
```yaml
- name: Run Backend Unit Tests
  run: npm test

- name: Build Frontend
  run: npm run build
```

### STEP 3: Explain Selenium Tests Job (3 minutes)

**Highlight:**
```yaml
- name: Install Chrome Browser
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable

- name: Start Backend Server
  run: |
    npm start &
    curl -f http://localhost:5000

- name: Run Selenium UI Tests
  run: npm run test:selenium
```

**Key Points:**
- "Chrome browser is installed for UI testing"
- "Both backend and frontend servers are started"
- "11 Selenium tests run automatically"
- "Tests include login and event creation scenarios"

### STEP 4: Trigger Pipeline (LIVE DEMO - 5 minutes)

**Option A: Make a small change**
```bash
# In terminal
cd "d:\QA\New folder\QA- final\QA- final"
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger CI/CD pipeline for viva"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual trigger**
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Select **CI/CD Pipeline**
4. Click **Run workflow** button
5. Select **main** branch
6. Click **Run workflow**

**Key Points:**
- "I'm now pushing a commit to trigger the pipeline"
- "The pipeline will start automatically"
- "Let's watch it execute in real-time"

### STEP 5: Show Pipeline Execution (5 minutes)

**Navigate to GitHub:**
1. Open: `https://github.com/ChamodiBandara/QAproject/actions`
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Show the jobs running

**Explain what to show:**

**Running State:**
```
🟡 build-and-test (Node 18.x) - In progress
🟡 build-and-test (Node 20.x) - In progress
⚪ selenium-tests - Waiting
⚪ report - Waiting
```

**Click on running job to show:**
- ✓ Checkout repository
- ✓ Setup Node.js
- ✓ Install Backend Dependencies
- 🔄 Run Backend Unit Tests (currently running)

**Key Points:**
- "Jobs run in parallel where possible"
- "Each step is logged with detailed output"
- "Green checkmarks show completed steps"

### STEP 6: Show Test Results (3 minutes)

**When tests complete, show:**

**Build & Test Job:**
```
✓ Checkout repository (2s)

```

**Selenium Tests Job:**
```
✓ Install Chrome Browser (18s)
✓ Start Backend Server (10s)
✓ Start Frontend Server (8s)
✓ Run Selenium UI Tests (46s)
  
  Admin Login UI Tests
    ✔ should load the login page successfully
    ✔ should show error message when fields are empty
    ✔ should successfully login with valid credentials
    ✔ should show error with invalid credentials
    ✔ should verify all form elements are present
  
  Create Event UI Tests
    ✔ should load the events dashboard page after login
    ✔ should open create event modal when clicking add button
    ✔ should show validation error when submitting empty event form
    ✔ should successfully create a new event with valid data
    ✔ should verify all required fields in create event form
    ✔ should close the modal when clicking close button
  
  11 passing (46s)

✓ Stop Servers (1s)
```

**Key Points:**
- "All unit tests passed successfully"
- "Frontend built without errors"
